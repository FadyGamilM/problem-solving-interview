# Problem :
Given an integer array of length n, find the index of the first duplicate element in the
array and state the runtime and space complexity of your implementation, for example: <br>
```go
    // returns 3, assuming the index starts with 0
    index_of_first_duplicate( [ 5, 17, 3, 17, 4, -1 ] )
```
# Complexity :

	➜  Time Complexity is O(n) in the most bad worst depressed case :( the complexity will be O(n*n) because the hash collosion but its too rare 
	➜  Space Complexity is O(n) in worst case all items are unqiue
